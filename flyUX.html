                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        Usability testing is the cornerstone of UX research. Without it, we aren’t putting the user at the center of our designs and fail to properly complete our initial goals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin my project, I conducted a number of usability tests with users that had recently booked flights through a airlines website. I conducted initial interviews where I was able to gain insight into the main use cases, common complaints, and the type of users and how their inner process works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From these interviews, I went forward to conduct usability tests. I gave the users a mock scenario and asked them to navigate through airline websites (such as Aer Lingus and Ryanair) to complete their goal of booking a flight. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to see users navigate through software in real time in order to get richer data and insights into their processes. While my data from the initial interviews was insightful, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the user’s thoughts through the usability tests.

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>From my findings during the initial research stage, I went forward to create an affinity diagram. This is an important method to take the large amount of data gathered during our research phase and organise it into groups according to their similarity.</p>
                    <p>Through creating an affinity diagram I was given a stronger understanding of my research. Examining each piece of data and organising them into similar groups gave me a chance to fully understand the insights gained as well as know the overarching areas that I needed to address further down the road in both the analysis and design phases.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">

                    <div class="col-md-6">

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>A customer journey map tells us the story of our users experience through the process. It opens at initial contact and tracks their engagement and experiences throughout.</p>
                    <p>While a customer journey map is incredibly helpful for giving an overview of the entire experience, it also gives a chance to focus on a particular part of the process.</p>
                    <p>I went through the data I had gathered and organised my insights per stage in the journey, rather than into similar groups like the affinity diagram. I broke the data down into 5 main categories : goals, context, behaviours, mental models, and pain points.
                        <br />
                        Once I had analysed my research data and collated it into clear, organised diagrams, I began the design phase.</p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <div class="col-md-6"></div>
                <p>The design phase was conducted in two stages: paper prototypes & sketches and a medium-fidelity prototype.</p>
                <p>I began the design phase by taking my conclusions from the analysis phase and creating an overarching user flow through the booking process. From here, I could devise a list of pages and screen states that needed to be designed.</p>
                <p>Once I was happy with the final sketches, I reviewed them against my results from earlier stages. When I had ensured I had solved any outstanding issues that users had faced, I was confident to bring the sketches into a medium-fidelity prototype</p>

                <h3> Prototype </h3>
                <p>I brought my final sketches and user flow diagrams into Adobe XD to create a medium fidelity prototype. <br />At this stage, the website begins to take its final form, with the digital designs in place and some interactivity available.</p>
                <p>During this process, another usability test was done to validate conclusions and improve on any outstanding issues. The final prototype, linked below, is a result of following through on the UX design process to ensure a high-quality system made with the user in centre focus.</p>

            <h3> Key Takeaways </h3>
            <p>This was my first project exploring a user-centered approach to design. Through my work, I learnt the true value of putting the user first and backing my designs with well-earned qualitative and quantitative research.</p>
            <p>As well as learning how to apply user-centred research in my own designs, I gained valuable knowledge in how to translate these insights to a wider team and work together to analyse data in a collaborative effort.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project was a positive first step entering into the world of UX Design and I gained an appreciation for the nuance and meticulous craft involved in creating valuable user interfaces and user experiences.</p>
